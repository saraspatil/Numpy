## Numpy
NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.

Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open source project.

### Operations using NumPy
Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations âˆ’

* Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

* Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.

* Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.
